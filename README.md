# Optimised-Prime-Number-Generator

Testing different prime number generator algorithms and primality tests. (Under Construction)

Naive Generator - Naive/Basic Implementation of Prime Number Generator 
Classical Generator - Using some basic Number Theory theorems to make improvements to the Naive Generator 
Optimised Generator - Using further number theory concepts to minimise random guessing and maximise accuracy 
Composite Test - Miller Rabin Deterministic Composite Test (more tests to be added soon!)
PrimeHelpers - List of functions to used in the generators. 
HelperFunctions - List of useful array (and non-array) functions to avoid redundancy and make code cleaner 

Misc.:
Primes1.txt - List of primes up until $2^{23}$
MakeListOfPrimes - Imports Primes.txt
CodeDump - Temporary local repository of the code.
